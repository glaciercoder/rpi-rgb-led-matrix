# RGB CUBE working journal

This project is targeted at mimicking 3D object on three vertical LED planes.



# Day1

1. Buy some components needed.(74HCT245)

2. Look up documents for algorithms:

## Develop plan

1. Implement a ray casting in python.
2. Implement 3D rendering on one plane.
3.  transfer 3D rendering results in three vertical planes



Today I finished the basic frame for boundary construction and collision detection
